Marsh Column Model
===================================

The marsh column model, developed by [Simon M. Mudd](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/smudd). 

Model has been used for these papers:

At the moment this is just a transfer of the files; I've changed some file naming conventions so it needs some work!
